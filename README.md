# MongoDB as a Service (MDBAAS)

This repo was created as a demonstration for a talk given at MongoDB World 2017 by Michael Lynn

## Getting Started

If you want to create your own MongoDB as a Service, you may use this project as a starting point.  You will need the following in order to proceed:

### Prerequisites

* Knowledge of the MEAN Stack

This project was written using NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB.

* An AWS Account

Because I can't know what type of hardware you have available, I chose to create this demo system leveraging AWS, more specifically, EC2 instances.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

```sh
$ git clone git://github.com/mrlynn/mdbaas.git
$ npm install
$ cp .env.example .env
$ mkdir ~/.aws
$ echo "[default]" > ~/.aws/credentials
$ echo "aws_access_key_id = OKIART2LTDTXUQPOLGGZNJQ" >> ~/.aws/credentials
$ echo "aws_secret_access_key = +1z4Mg99h93ryYcejkerk5iix4BLika++7KjFoVZ" >> ~/.aws/credentials
$ echo npm start
```

Then visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)


End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
